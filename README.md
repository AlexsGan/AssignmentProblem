# AssignmentProblem
A job distributor that minimizes the cost of the company.

  Suppose you are the owner of a manufacturing company and have a staff of 7 people. There are 7 job 
tasks that each person can do but each person gets paid at a different rate for each task. This program
distribute the jobs to minimize the cost using recursion. (The input will be 7 rows by 
8 columns)

	In the assignmentInput.txt file, enter a name followed by 7 costs in the first line (with space between 
each value/name entered), then repeat 6 times in the next 6 lines. 

Output:	 The program outputs the total minimum cost and the specific job that each worker gets.

Process:  Use a recursion method to find all the possible job configurations to find the minimum total cost and its 
	specific job configuration (the 1st combination found).
